# California-Housing-Price-Prediction
This project is going to develop California-Housing-Price-Prediction using the Machine Learning Algorithms

Welcome to the California Housing Corporation for Machine Learning! The first task is to create a model of California property prices using census data. Each California census tract's demographics and economics are broken down here, with numbers like population, average income, and average home cost at the fingertips. Block groups (a block group generally has a population of 600 to 3,000 persons) are the smallest geographic unit for which the United States Census Bureau publishes sample data; these groupings are referred to as "districts" for reference. With the use of this Machine Learning model, this program would be able to make educated guesses about the median home price in each neighborhood, given the other data.



Main step for machine Learning Projects.

1. Look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine-tune your model.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.

# Follow below instruction to start your projects.

1. Create a github repo.
2. Clone github repo in your system
  ```
  git clone <github-url>
  ```
3. Open folder in vscode.

4. Create project folder structure based on standard practices.
   
   First download a bash script file.
  
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iNeuron-Pvt-Ltd/housing_prediciton/main/inital_bash_script.sh">
Download initial script file.
  </a>

5. Run bash script using below command

```
bash <script_name>
```
Update setup.py file with following contain
```
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

REQUIREMENT_FILE_NAME = "requirements.txt"
REMOVE_PACKAGE = "-e ."


def get_requirement_list(requirement_file_name=REQUIREMENT_FILE_NAME) -> list:
    try:
        requirement_list = None
        with open(requirement_file_name) as requirement_file:
            requirement_list = [requirement.replace("\n", "") for requirement in requirement_file]
            requirement_list.remove(REMOVE_PACKAGE)
        return requirement_list
    except Exception as e:
        raise e


setup(
    name="Housing price prediction",
    license="MIT",
    version="0.0.0",
    description="Project has been completed.",
    author="Avnish Yadav",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=get_requirement_list()
)
```

6. Add following library in requirements.txt file.

```
scikit-learn
scipy 
PyYAML
gunicorn
pandas
-e .
six
dill
Flask
```

7. Create a app.py and create a sample hello world flask app.


8. To send changes to github repo 

To add all changes into git stage
```
git add .
```

To check all files that we are about to commit.
```
git status 
```
Commit all files added in git stage
```
git commit -m "<message>"
```

If your git account is not configured.

Execute below command to configure your git.
```
git config --global user.name "<user>"
```
```
git config --global user.email "<user_email>"
```
To check remote branch url
```
git remote -v
```
To send your commit to remote branch

git push <var_name> <branch_name>



update your commited files in github repo
```
git push origin main
```

## Create an Account at heroku

Create an App at heroku
We need 3 information to setup github action
1. Heroku API KEY
2. Heroku APP Name
3. Heroku Account Emaild Id

Let's create a docker file for our application

Create file .dockerignore and Dockerfile

Create a folder directory .github/workflows/main.yaml

Check github workflow code from below link.

<a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-push-and-release-a-docker-container-to-heroku">Build and Deploy Docker image to Heroku container.</a>

Add the content from above webpage.


Add repo secret in github

Note: Kindly check your variable name in github/workflows/main.yaml file.

setting> secrets> Add new Repository Secrets.

Add folder name in .dockerignore file that are not needed in Docker image

Again send changes to Github repo.

Basic Project CI/CD setup completed.

Operation Step:
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
source virtualenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
